# Planning Algorithms

Planning algorithms implemented for a simple 2D grid search space.

Can draw an occupancy map and/or randomly generate a maze.

Can choose a planner, set the start and goal positions, and view the planner as it explores the search space.

Currently only A* is implemented, with a solution shown below.
